myself missing the comfort of static types. Enter MyPy, a standalone typechecker
which uses a bunch of the new features in Python 3 to make the language more
friendly to us type-lovers.</p>
<p>Let&apos;s jump right in!</p>
<p>You will need:</p>
<ul>
<li>A text editor and a Unix command prompt</li>
<li>Familiarity with some basic programming concepts: functions, writing output,
and getting input</li>
<li>Python 3.5 (in Part 2 of the tutorial, we&apos;ll be using the <code>typing</code> module,
which is new in 3.5)</li>
<li>A desire to catch more bugs earlier in the development process!</li>
</ul>
<p>This tutorial is aimed at people with some programming experience but little to
no experience with static typing, including but not limited to: first- and
second-year college students, self-taught/hobbyist programmers (welcome,
GirlDevelopIt members!), and students in online programs like Udacity.</p>

<h1 id="installing-mypy"><a href="#Installing-MyPy" class="headerlink" title="Installing MyPy"></a>Installing MyPy</h1><p>MyPy might be available through your Linux distribution&apos;s package manager. If it
is, I recommend grabbing it from there (it&apos;s what I do). If not, you&apos;ll need to
download it yourself, as follows.</p>
<p>If you have some experience using Python libraries, you might be used to getting
them directly from PYPI; unfortunately, as of this writing, the version of MyPy
on PYPI isn&apos;t compatible with Python 3.5. To get around this, we&apos;ll install
directly from the MyPy git repository:</p>
<figure class="highlight sh"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line">$ pip3 install git+git://github.com/python/mypy.git</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<h1 id="getting-started"><a href="#Getting-Started" class="headerlink" title="Getting Started"></a>Getting Started</h1><p>First, let&apos;s make sure your tools are set up correctly. Try saving this code in
a file named &quot;hello1.py&quot; and running it with <code>python3.5 hello1.py</code>:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><figcaption><span>hello1.py</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title">get_message</span><span class="params">()</span> -&gt; <span class="title">str</span>:</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> input(<span class="string">&apos;Type something:&apos;</span>)</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">s = get_message()</span><br><span class="line">print(s)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>It should prompt you to enter some text, print what you typed, and then exit.</p>
<p>The only part of this code that&apos;s different from &quot;normal&quot; Python is the type
annotation on the get_message function. Where <code>def get_message()</code> means
&quot;get_message is a function&quot;, <code>def get_message() -&gt; str</code> means &quot;get_message is a
function that returns a string&quot;.</p>
<p>The type annotation serves two purposes: to make it easier for other humans to
read your code, and to enable MyPy to detect errors in your code before you run
it. (Actually, MyPy could typecheck this without an annotation, but we&apos;ll get to
that later.)</p>
<p>To see MyPy in action, try typechecking the code with <code>mypy hello1.py</code>. Like many
Linux programs, MyPy will print nothing when it runs successfully; since there
aren&apos;t any mismatched types in this code, you shouldn&apos;t see any output after
running the command.</p>
<p>Congratulations, you&apos;ve just typechecked a Python program for the first time!</p>
<h2 id="making-mistakes"><a href="#Making-Mistakes" class="headerlink" title="Making Mistakes"></a>Making Mistakes</h2><p>Okay, so that was a little bit anticlimactic. You wrote those extra seven
characters to give the get_message function a type, and nothing even happened!
Let&apos;s see where MyPy really shines: when your code <em>isn&apos;t</em> right.</p>
<p>Make a new copy of your file. Now edit it to claim that get_message returns an
integer, by changing <code>str</code> to <code>int</code> on the first line.  Your code should look
like this now:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><figcaption><span>hello2.py</span></figcaption><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title">get_message</span><span class="params">()</span> -&gt; <span class="title">int</span>:</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> input(<span class="string">&apos;Type something:&apos;</span>)</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">s = get_message()</span><br><span class="line">print(s)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Before running it, try checking it with MyPy. You should get an error message
indicating the line number and saying something like &quot;Incompatible return value:
expected builtins.int, got builtins.str&quot;.</p>
<p>What just happened? We told MyPy that get_message returns an integer, but MyPy
noticed that the return statement in get_message returns the result of a call to
the &quot;input&quot; function, which always returns a string. (Since the input function
is built in to Python, MyPy can look up its type on its own, and we don&apos;t need
to write its type in our own code.)</p>
<p>Here&apos;s where it gets really interesting. Go ahead and run this code with Python.
You&apos;ll notice that nothing bad happens; in fact, this program acts exactly like
the program from before. What&apos;s going on?</p>
<p>Without wandering too deep into the dark forest of compiler theory, we can say
that this happens because the <em>typechecking</em> stage and the <em>execution</em> stage
occur separately. Typically this feature is a hallmark of compiled languages
like C++ and Java, whereas interpreted languages like Python and Ruby do
typechecking while the program is running (aptly named &quot;run-time typechecking&quot;),
but there&apos;s no rule preventing us from typechecking a program in <em>any</em> language
before running it!</p>
<p>This is really important to understand: <strong>MyPy annotations don&apos;t affect your
program while it&apos;s running. They only help you catch more bugs <em>before</em> runnning
your code.</strong></p>
<h2 id="a-slightly-better-example"><a href="#A-Slightly-Better-Example" class="headerlink" title="A Slightly Better Example"></a>A Slightly Better Example</h2><p>That was awesome, but at this point it all probably feels contrived, and you
might be wondering why this is important. Or maybe you&apos;re convinced, but still
a little uncertain about how to use MyPy in a more realistic scenario.</p>
<p>Imagine that you wanted to get a user&apos;s favorite number. You might write code
that looks something like this:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title">get_favorite_number</span><span class="params">()</span>:</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> input(<span class="string">&apos;Enter your favorite number: &apos;</span>)</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">num = get_favorite_number()</span><br><span class="line">print(<span class="string">&apos;Your favorite number is&apos;</span>, num)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>You can save and run this code, and it will work. But even though it doesn&apos;t
crash, there&apos;s still a problem with it: get_favorite_number doesn&apos;t actually
return a number! This is what we call a <strong>semantic</strong> problem: it isn&apos;t &quot;wrong&quot; in
a technical sense, but it represents a mismatch between <em>your idea of what the
code means</em> and <em>what the code actually means</em>.</p>
<p>This distinction can be difficult to understand at first, so don&apos;t worry if it
doesn&apos;t make sense yet. Just know that it makes more sense for a function that
returns a number to, well, return an actual number. This will become apparent
when we try to actually use the number in a &quot;number-y&quot; way:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title">get_favorite_number</span><span class="params">()</span>:</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> input(<span class="string">&apos;Enter your favorite number: &apos;</span>)</span><br><span class="line"></span><br><span class="line">num = get_favorite_number()</span><br><span class="line">print(<span class="string">&apos;Twice your favorite number is&apos;</span>, <span class="number">2</span>*num)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>What happens when we run this code?</p>
<p>Think about it and try to guess what will happen, and then go run the code and
test your prediction.</p>
<p>You&apos;ll notice that this code has some... <em>interesting</em> behavior. Specifically,
if you tell it that your favorite number is 5, it will tell you that twice your
favorite number is 55. Which is technically true, as far as Python is concerned,
but it&apos;s probably not what you meant.</p>
<p><strong>This kind of bug--where your program doesn&apos;t crash, but does something wrong
and continues running--is what static typecheckers like MyPy excel at finding.</strong></p>
<p>&quot;Okay,&quot; you say, &quot;that&apos;s nice, but I would totally notice this as soon as I ran
the program!&quot;. Yeah, you would, but what if it were part of a web form? You
might not notice it until you realized that all the numbers in your database
were numbers like 3131, 77, 101101, and 00. &quot;00&quot; would probably be the biggest
red flag, since programming languages usually don&apos;t display leading zeros unless
you explicitly ask for them. By this point, you might have gone days or weeks
collecting wrong data.</p>
<p>And yes, you could go through and fix this manually, but the point is to avoid
problems like this in the first place. For example, you would have some very
angry customers on your hands if you entered the price of a shirt as &quot;20&quot; and
your website tried to charge them $2,020 to buy two shirts.</p>
<p>Let&apos;s start fixing our code. First, let&apos;s formalize the idea that
get_favorite_number should return an integer, by giving it a type annotation.
(From now on, I&apos;m only going to reproduce the part of the code that changes.)</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title">get_favorite_number</span><span class="params">()</span> -&gt; <span class="title">int</span>:</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> input(<span class="string">&apos;Enter your favorite number: &apos;</span>)</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Try running MyPy on this code. It should display the same error as it did with
&quot;hello2.py&quot;: expected an integer, got a string.</p>
<p>We have two choices: we can change the return type to <code>str</code>, or we can change
the function body so it actually returns an <code>int</code>. We&apos;re going to do the latter,
since it matches up with our goal.</p>
<p>In Python, you can convert a string to an integer by wrapping it in the <code>int</code>
constructor, so let&apos;s do that:</p>
<figure class="highlight python"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><span class="line"><span class="function"><span class="keyword">def</span> <span class="title">get_favorite_number</span><span class="params">()</span> -&gt; <span class="title">int</span>:</span></span><br><span class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> int(input(<span class="string">&apos;Enter your favorite number: &apos;</span>))</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Now, if we tell it our favorite number is 5, it actually prints 10. And the way
our code is written matches up with our intuitive understanding of what it&apos;s
supposed to do, which will make it much easier for other programmers (including
our future selves) to read.</p>
<p>Success!</p>
<h1 id="digging-deeper"><a href="#Digging-Deeper" class="headerlink" title="Digging Deeper"></a>Digging Deeper</h1><p>We&apos;ll continue the saga of static typing in Python next time with Part 2 of this
tutorial, in which we write our own class for array-backed lists and implement
sorting with a custom predicate. Stay tuned, even if that sounds confusing!
<em>Especially</em> if it sounds confusing.</p>
<p>I&apos;ll also have something to say at some point about the unique properties of the
<code>None</code> type, and how to take advantage of it when developing larger projects
with MyPy.</p>
<p>In the meanwhile, play around with MyPy on your own! Adding annotations to some
previous code you&apos;ve written is a great way to build familiarity with the tool.
(Just remember to make a copy of your files or check them into a git repository
first!)</p>
