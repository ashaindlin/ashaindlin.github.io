<h1 id="the-short-list"><a href="#the-short-list" class="headerlink" title="the short list"></a>the short list</h1><ul>
<li>I went to POPL/PLMW in January, met a ton of awesome people, and learned more
in a week than I usually would learn in a 16-week semester of college.</li>
<li>I finished my Bachelor&apos;s degree. (It only took 8 years. To be fair, I started
when I was 12.)</li>
<li>I got into graduate school; all three I applied to, actually. (See note 1.)</li>
<li>I accepted one of the offers and in August I moved to Finland to start my
Master&apos;s degree! (See note 2.)</li>
<li>I started knitting again. I finished a couple lovely things and started
several other lovely things which are still on the needles.</li>
<li>I studied violin for a few more months before stopping (at first due to my
health in the summer, and now due to money, sadly). I got to try an electric
violin (both the Yamaha SV130 and the SV200) for the first time last month!
(See note 3.)</li>
<li>I continued studying classical music composition and orchestration and all
that good stuff. I&apos;m especially proud of my new knowledge of Roman numeral
analysis; it&apos;s still elementary, but I can reliably identify and voice triads
and sevenths and their inversions in common practice period works, which is
the first layer of the foundation for this type of analysis.</li>
<li>I made significant progress in treating my ADD and dysautonomia. (I still
haven&apos;t figured out whether I&apos;m supposed to call it ADD or ADHD, and I still
don&apos;t know what kind of dysautonomia I have, although we&apos;re almost certain
it&apos;s either POTS or IST. Fortunately, these details don&apos;t matter.)</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="music"><a href="#music" class="headerlink" title="music"></a>music</h1><p>This is getting its own separate section, because I was going to have &quot;some good
albums came out&quot; as one bullet point in the above list but then it kind of got
out of hand. The list is alphabetical by artist, and each album has a Spotify
link after the name.</p>
<p><strong>Dalriada - Forr&#xE1;s</strong>
[<a href="https://play.spotify.com/album/7AmTFZLUdkKHLjSjJpzMW9" target="_blank" rel="external">x</a>]. Acoustic versions
of songs from the band&apos;s previous albums (and one cover song). This quickly
became a staple of my studying playlist. Standout track: &quot;T&#xE9;li &#xE9;nek&quot; is smooth
like butter.</p>
<p><strong>Grimner - Frost Mot Eld</strong>
[<a href="https://play.spotify.com/album/6vgOKg67gBaXP3P7QJlcyL" target="_blank" rel="external">x</a>]. If everything else
on this list is too plain <em>weird</em> for you... Frost Mot Eld is recognizable as a
heavy metal album with catchy riffs. Standout track: &quot;M&#xF6;rkrets Hem&quot; is equally
well-suited to headbanging or to folk dancing.</p>
<p><strong>Moonsorrow - Jumalten Aika</strong>
[<a href="https://play.spotify.com/album/4lNfKXCC8LLMeTr89vRF1D" target="_blank" rel="external">x</a>]. I never really
liked Moonsorrow, despite everything they have in common with some of my
favorite artists... until this album. I have zero reservations about calling it
The One Folk Metal Album You Need To Hear this year. Standout track: the whole
album is one streamlined auditory experience and I can&apos;t in good conscience
recommend any one track in isolation. Go sit in the forest for 67 minutes and
listen to the whole thing.</p>
<p><strong>Thy Catafalque - Meta</strong>
[<a href="https://play.spotify.com/album/6lneG1IkSB7EQSiow6sRao" target="_blank" rel="external">x</a>]. This is some kind
of vaguely medieval-sounding release from a one-person metal project. Perfect
for listening to while you stare out the window on a long bus ride. Standout
track: &quot;Ixion Duun&quot; takes you on an almost meditative journey.</p>
<p><strong>Utopianisti - The Third Frontier</strong>
[<a href="https://play.spotify.com/album/4WFXfk6YjOvAdLyhkrjk4j" target="_blank" rel="external">x</a>]. Experimental jazz
(?) from right here in Tampere. This was a late contender, since I had no idea
it existed until I saw it on Mathias Nyg&#xE5;rd&apos;s best of 2016 playlist last week,
but it&apos;s awesome. I spent most of December trying to get into jazz but not
finding any that really spoke to me, so this was a very welcome last-minute
find. Standout track: &quot;Voodoo Mammoths From Neptune&quot; is an exciting blend of old
and new sounds that sets up the rest of the album perfectly.</p>
<p><strong>Witchery - In His Infernal Majesty&apos;s Service</strong>
[<a href="https://play.spotify.com/album/3pdTrqM2AZWRCXJJTsGplS" target="_blank" rel="external">x</a>]. For a band with
such an aggressive sound (Encyclopaedia Metallum calls them &quot;blackened
speed/thrash metal&quot;), this release is impressively full of earworm-worthy hooks!
It&apos;s a bit heavy on the guitar solos near the middle of the album, but otherwise
it&apos;s a tightly mixed wall of black metal sound that evokes Watain and The
Iniquity Descent, seasoned with thrash to taste. Standout track: the opener
&quot;Lavey-athan&quot; punches you in the face in a good way.</p>
<p>Honorable mentions:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Arkona - Vozrozhdenie</strong>
[<a href="https://play.spotify.com/album/5dQYVuXsioqdyQtjYnbraR" target="_blank" rel="external">x</a>]. This is a
re-recording of their debut album. I haven&apos;t listened to it all the way
through yet, but Arkona is consistently good.</li>
<li><strong>Ensiferum - Two Decades Of Greatest Sword Hits</strong>
[<a href="https://play.spotify.com/album/2TUPtzvKFNEzdtRKUUvIZN" target="_blank" rel="external">x</a>]. This is a
&quot;greatest hits&quot; album which I&apos;m including for completeness because I adore
Ensiferum. <em>Voiton laulut soi ainiaan!</em></li>
<li><strong>Sabaton - The Last Stand</strong>
[<a href="https://play.spotify.com/album/1hFJW50enCkVVhKg9gA303" target="_blank" rel="external">x</a>]. It&apos;s exactly the
same as every other Sabaton album. Fortunately, they&apos;re all pretty good.</li>
<li><strong>Sk&#xE1;lm&#xF6;ld - V&#xF6;gguv&#xED;sur Yggdrasils</strong>
[<a href="https://play.spotify.com/album/2lUucfvLTZSgHI6hWVIHtc" target="_blank" rel="external">x</a>]. Not bad, but has
too many tracks that just bore me. It should&apos;ve either been 10 minutes shorter
or 10% more adventurous.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="notes"><a href="#notes" class="headerlink" title="notes"></a>notes</h1><h2 id="on-grad-school-applications"><a href="#on-grad-school-applications" class="headerlink" title="on grad school applications"></a>on grad school applications</h2><p>In late 2015 I decided that I wanted to move to Finland, so when I was looking
at programs, I pretty much exclusively considered Finnish universities. When I
was applying to undergraduate universities a few years ago, I did basically the
same thing: decided where I wanted to live and then applied to whichever
universit(y|ies) there which I thought would be likely to admit me but not so
&quot;easy&quot; that I wouldn&apos;t learn cool things.</p>
<p>I&apos;ve actually gotten into every university I&apos;ve applied to, both for undergrad
and for grad school; the only university I&apos;ve been rejected from is Bryn Mawr,
and that was because I didn&apos;t complete my application on time. (Of course, I
have no idea whether or not they would have admitted me if I&apos;d met the
deadlines.) One of my goals for the next couple years is to have at least one
Ph.D. application rejected, which probably sounds weird, but for my
undergraduate and first graduate school applications I didn&apos;t apply to <em>any</em>
&quot;reach&quot; schools, and in hindsight it&apos;s painfully obvious to me that I limited
myself because I didn&apos;t believe in my own intelligence and my own potential. </p>
<p>Yes, I have a serious case of impostor syndrome and I near-compulsively downplay
my own achievements. It&apos;s a seemingly inevitable part of being a woman
(especially a chronically ill woman) in STEM.</p>
<p>I need to break the cycle of drastically understating my own competence and then
getting surprised and offended when I end up in an environment where it&apos;s not
easy to find the intellectual stimulation I crave.</p>
<h2 id="on-finland-and-the-general-state-of-my-education"><a href="#on-Finland-and-the-general-state-of-my-education" class="headerlink" title="on Finland, and the general state of my education"></a>on Finland, and the general state of my education</h2><p>Moving here was definitely the right choice for my mental and physical health,
but I feel kind of stagnant academically now... I think I&apos;m actually a less
competent type theorist/PL theorist than I was six months ago, because I&apos;m out
of practice, but the majority of that is on me, not on my uni.</p>
<p>I&apos;m going to POPL and PLMW again this year (yay!) and I&apos;m kind of relying on
that, plus the promise of a full year without severe summer heat fatigue <em>for
the first time in my life</em>, to get me excited about computer science again.</p>
<h2 id="on-the-yamaha-silent-violin-line"><a href="#on-the-Yamaha-Silent-Violin-line" class="headerlink" title="on the Yamaha Silent Violin line"></a>on the Yamaha Silent Violin line</h2><p>The built-in &quot;Hall 2&quot; reverb on the SV130 is addictive and obviously you can&apos;t
beat the price on that model but unfortunately the built-in shoulder rest
doesn&apos;t work with my body. I&apos;m not comfortable with the external control box on
the SV150, so I tried the SV200, and was pleased to find that the extra weight
of the onboard electronics doesn&apos;t bother me! One day... <em>sigh</em>.</p>
<h1 id="looking-forward-to-2017"><a href="#looking-forward-to-2017" class="headerlink" title="looking forward to 2017"></a>looking forward to 2017</h1><p>I&apos;m going to at least one conference and I should be 75% done with my first
graduate degree at the end of the year. I&apos;m continuing to study music and
improve my Finnish, and I&apos;ll be starting a YouTube channel. Here&apos;s to lots more
captivating music, healthy food, and interesting computer science papers in
2017!</p>
